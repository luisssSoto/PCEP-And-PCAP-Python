'''High-level programs were developed with the idea of speeding up 
and essentially making it possible to communicate with our computer 
and give it instructions. A program written in a high-level 
programming language is called source code or a script, while the 
file that stores it is called a source file. Some high-level 
languages include:

*C
*C+/C#
*Java
*Python
*Javascript
*Perl
*Kotlin
*Swift
among others.'''
