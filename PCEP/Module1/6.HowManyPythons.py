'''Versions:
There are two versions of Python: version 2, which still has 
several applications designed with it, and version 3, which is 
more current and still being updated. It's important to mention 
that both versions are not compatible, and code written in Python 2 
cannot be interpreted by the Python 3 interpreter and vice versa.

CPython:
Originally written in the high-level programming language "C" by 
Guido, many of C's characteristics are obtained, such as 
portability. In fact, when updating or implementing any changes in 
Python, it must be accepted by the Python Software Foundation (PSF),
managed by Guido himself, and still use this language for many of 
their updates today.

Cython:
Can you imagine writing code in Python but interpreting it in C? 
This is possible thanks to Cython, aiming to achieve a script with
 fewer lines of code but interpreted more quickly thanks to C.

Jython follows Python 2 implementations.
PYPY and RPython follow Python 3 implementations.'''
