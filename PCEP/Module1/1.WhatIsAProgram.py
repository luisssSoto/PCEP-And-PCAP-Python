'''Computer programs nowadays are so common that we use them daily,
often without even being aware of it. We use them to listen to a 
song, to find the best route to our destination, to search a 
website, use social networks, instant messaging, and the list goes 
on. Every day, hundreds of applications are launched, generally 
helping to simplify our daily lives.

All these applications or programs are written using programming, 
which is nothing more than writing a list of instructions (IL) for 
our computer to execute and then run that famous application you 
use daily.'''
