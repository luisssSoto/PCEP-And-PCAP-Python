'''There are two types of languages:
Natural language, such as our mother tongue or body language.
Machine language, which is what our computer reads and understands, 
often depicted as a series of zeros and ones grouped together 
(01010) in science fiction movies.

Regardless of the language, they must have certain characteristics:
Alphabet
Lexicon
Syntax
Semantics

To communicate with our computer and make it execute an IL, we need
a language that acts as a bridge between our mother tongue and 
machine language, namely a high-level programming language.'''
