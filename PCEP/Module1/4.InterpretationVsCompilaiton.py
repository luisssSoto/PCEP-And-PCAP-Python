'''Once we've written our code in the chosen programming language, 
it needs to be translated into machine language for the computer 
to work with and run one of the many applications you already know.

But how does this happen? It usually occurs in two different ways: 
compiling or interpreting.

Compiling:
The code is compiled using a translator or compiler into machine 
language. Once compiled into a file, it can be executed on any 
computer. However, if you want to modify any block of code, you 
need to modify the source file again and then recompile it to 
generate another source file with the new updates. Due to this, at
the time of execution, it is faster than interpreted programming 
languages since they are already fully translated into machine 
language. However, you need various compilers for the hardware 
platforms you decide to run it on.

Interpreting:
The code is interpreted by an interpreter as it is being executed. 
This process is slower than its compiled counterpart since it is 
saved in a file with an extension of the programming language 
rather than machine language, making it more portable. The user 
who wants to execute the program only needs to have the 
interpreter, and it will do all the work.'''
