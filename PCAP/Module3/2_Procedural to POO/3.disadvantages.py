""" Disadvantages of Procedural Approach """
'''
1. The main variable; stack is not protected so anyone accidentally or not could damage
it 
2. The code could be growth excessively, when we want to repeat the number of the stacks
or the same functions of the stacks
3. Maybe we want to create more functions for the stack and don't do it from 0, because
you've already write a couple of functions, so you want to start from there'''

'''Advantages of POO
It is interesting how the advantages of the POO handle with the disadvantages of the 
Procedural Approach:
1. Encapsulation
2. Classes
3. Inheritance'''
