""" POO Way """
'''POO'''
''' it is a way to take any idea of the real world and convert it to a 
class, so in this scenario the data lives, let me explain with an example: '''

'''Class'''
# Anime 

'''but at the same time, it could be more classes that belong the first one:'''

''' Superclass '''
# Anime

'''Subclass'''
# Kodomo       
'''Subclass'''
# Shonen

'''So, the hierarchy could be just like this, as you can see exist one
superclass (Anime) and two subclases (Kodomo and Shonen) which belong
to Anime '''
# Anime <- Kodomo 
#       <- Shonen
