""" My first Object """
''' You need to create an object and at the same time save that object in a variable,
this proccess is called "instantiation" because we are creating one instace of the 
class, and the syntax is just like below here: '''

class Shinobi:
    pass

neji = Shinobi()    

'''Note: remember that all the elements inside a class are inherited to its subclass, so 
that in this case nothing is inherited to the object'''
