""" Procedural Approach"""
'''Procedural'''
''' This way was popular until appears POO...
It is used to small and specific proyects.
Here exist two worlds: the data and the code, here the functions
can use the data, but the data can't use the functions unless that data use
a method, 'cause the method is a kind a function but in this case the data
use the method and that is the first step into a POO.'''
