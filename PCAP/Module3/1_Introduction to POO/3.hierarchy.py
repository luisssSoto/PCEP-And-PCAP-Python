""" Hierarchy """
'''Class'''
# Anime 

'''but at the same time, it could be more classes that belong the first one:'''

''' Superclass '''
# Anime

'''Subclass'''
# Kodomo       
'''Subclass'''
# Shonen

'''So, the hierarchy could be just like this, as you can see exist one
superclass (Anime) and two subclases (Kodomo and Shonen) which belong
to Anime '''
# Anime <- Kodomo 
#       <- Shonen

''' But on the other hand the subclasses Kodomo and Shonen could be a superclasses to
other subclasses:'''
# Anime <- Kodomo <- Hamtaro 
#       <- Shonen <- Naruto

'''So in the case above, Kodomo is a subclass of Anime, but at the same time is a superclass
of Hamtaro'''
