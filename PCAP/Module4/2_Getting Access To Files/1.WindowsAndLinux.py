'''In order to access to any file, every SO have its own sintax to do it:'''
'''1.Windows'''
#This file is the same because windows doesn't care the upper and lower letters
path_windows1 = 'C:\\Users\\AlexSoto\\MyFile.py'
path_windows2 = 'C:\\Users\\AlexSoto\\myfile.py'
path_windows3 = 'C/Users/AlexSoto/myFile.py' # Python helps us to change the sintax for Windows

'''2.Linux'''
path_linux = '/users/AlexSoto'
